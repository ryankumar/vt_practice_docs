Stacks are a type of container adaptors with LIFO(Last In First Out) type of working, where a new element is added at one end and (top) an element is removed from that end only.
 
The functions associated with stack are:
1. empty() – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity : O(1)
2. size() – Returns the size of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1)
3. top() – Returns a reference to the top most element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1)
4. push(g) – Adds the element ‘g’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1)
5. pop() – Deletes the top most element of the stack – Time Complexity : O(1)
6.emplace() -This function is used to insert a new element into the stack container, the new element is added on top of the stack.

Note:
Q: Difference between stack::emplace() and stack::push() function ?
A: While push() function inserts a copy of the value or the parameter passed to the function into the container at the top, the emplace()         function constructs a new element as the value of the parameter and then adds it to the top of the container .
