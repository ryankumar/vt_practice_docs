some functionallity is same as list. hence follow list for below functionality .
1. push_front(), emplace_front() and pop_front() 
2. merge() :- This function is used to merge one forward list with other. If both the lists are sorted then the resulted list returned is also sorted.

3. operator “=” :- This operator copies one forward list into other. The copy made in this case is deep copy.
4. sort() :- This function is used to sort the forward list. 
5.  unique() :- This function deletes the multiple occurrences of a number and returns a forward list with unique elements. The forward list should be sorted for this function to execute successfully.

6. reverse() :- This function is used to reverse the forward list.

7. swap() :- This function swaps the content of one forward list with other.

8.. clear() :- This function clears the contents of forward list. After this function, the forward list becomes empty.

9. empty() :- This function returns true if the list is empty otherwise false.

NOTE : (ITERARTOR)

1.If A is an forward iterator, then
    A-- //not aplicable;

2.If A and B are forward iterators, then
  A == B     // Allowed
  A <= B     // Not Allowed

3.If A and B are forward iterators, then

 A + 1     // Not allowed
 B - 2     // Not allowed

4.If A is a forward iterator, then
 A[3]    // Not allowed
